## Current Focus

*   **Loft Management**: The current priority is to enhance the loft management module by fixing bugs and adding new features.

## Next Steps

1.  **~~Fix "Edit Loft" Form~~**: The "edit loft" form was not displaying all fields. This has been resolved by correcting the data fetching in `app/lofts/[id]/edit/page.tsx`.
2.  **~~Resolve Database Error~~**: A `TypeError` was occurring in the application. This has been resolved by updating the `ensureUsersTable` function in `app/actions/auth.ts` to use a `select` query instead of an `insert` statement to check for table existence. A patch has also been added to prevent future `TypeError` issues by ensuring the error message is a string before evaluation.
3.  **~~Fix i18n issues~~**: The internationalization file (`lib/i18n/translations.ts`) had syntax errors and duplicate keys. These issues have been resolved, and the file has been updated to include translations for the new "Reports" section.
4.  **Test and Verify**: Once the fixes are implemented, the loft management module needs to be thoroughly tested to ensure all features are working as expected.
