## 🧪 **Testing the System:**

### **Manual Testing Steps:**

#### **1. Test Task Assignment:**
```bash
# As Admin/Manager:
1. Go to /tasks/new
2. Create a new task
3. Assign it to another user
4. Check that the assigned user gets notification immediately
5. Verify red dot appears on their sidebar
6. Verify toast notification shows up
7. Verify browser notification (if permission granted)
```

#### **2. Test Task Reassignment:**
```bash
# As Admin/Manager:
1. Go to existing task /tasks/[id]/edit
2. Change the assigned user
3. Check both old and new assignees get notifications
4. Verify appropriate notification types (warning for old, info for new)
```

#### **3. Test Status Changes:**
```bash
# As assigned user:
1. Go to your assigned task
2. Change status from "todo" to "in_progress"
3. Check task creator gets notification
4. Change to "completed"
5. Verify success-type notification is sent
```

#### **4. Test Real-time Delivery:**
```bash
# Open two browser windows:
1. Window A: Admin user
2. Window B: Regular user
3. In Window A: Assign task to user in Window B
4. In Window B: Should see notification instantly without refresh
5. Check red dot appears on sidebar immediately
```

### **API Testing:**
```bash
# Test notification endpoint (Admin only):
POST /api/test-task-notification
{
  "userId": "user-uuid-here",
  "title": "Test Task Notification",
  "message": "This is a test notification for task assignment",
  "type": "info",
  "link": "/tasks/123"
}
```

## 🔧 **Database Setup:**

### **Required Schema Updates:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL editor:
-- (Copy content from database/task-notifications-schema.sql)

-- Key updates:
- Added 'type' column to notifications table
- Added 'sender_id' column for tracking who sent notification
- Added 'read_at' timestamp
- Created indexes for performance
- Enabled realtime subscriptions
- Updated RLS policies
```

### **Enable Realtime:**
In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to **Database** → **Replication**
2. Enable replication for `notifications` table
3. Verify `tasks` table is also enabled

## 🎨 **User Experience:**

### **What Users See:**
1. **🔴 Red badge** appears on sidebar "Notifications" menu
2. **📱 Toast notification** slides in from top-right
3. **🔔 Browser notification** (if permission granted)
4. **📧 In-app notification** in notifications page
5. **🔗 Click-to-navigate** to relevant task

### **Notification Examples:**
```
📋 "New Task Assigned"
   "You have been assigned a new task: 'Fix kitchen sink' (Due: Dec 25, 2024)"
   
🔄 "Task Reassigned"

```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Common Issues & Solutions:**

#### **1. Notifications Not Appearing:**
```bash
# Check these:
- Is Supabase Realtime enabled for notifications table?
- Are RLS policies correctly set?
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify user has notification permissions
```

#### **2. Real-time Not Working:**
```bash
# Debug steps:
- Check RealtimeProvider is wrapping the app
- Verify Supabase connection in browser dev tools
- Check if notifications table has realtime enabled
- Look for subscription errors in console
```

#### **3. Task Assignment Not Triggering Notifications:**
```bash
# Check these:
- Verify createNotification function is being called
- Check server logs for errors
- Ensure assigned user ID is valid
- Verify notification is being inserted in database
```

### **Debug Commands:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
// Check if realtime is connected
console.log('Supabase channels:', supabase.getChannels())

// Check notification permission
console.log('Notification permission:', Notification.permission)

// Test notification creation
fetch('/api/test-task-notification', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userId: 'your-user-id',
    title: 'Test',
    message: 'Test message',
    type: 'info'
  })
